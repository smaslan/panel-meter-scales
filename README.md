# Custom scales for analogue panel meters 
Sometimes, custom scale for analogue panel meter is needed. This repo contains few of mine scales. Drawings are based on scan of original scale. 

## China 85C1
So far I have worked with some Chinese meters 85C1. It seems that is currently almost only existing in the market. Strange thing is, its scale actually does not match the needle. There was angular error of the end ticks by at least 5 degrees. So I started by fixing that. I redrawn everything to vectors base on the scan of original. Next, I made few custom scales as were needed. All drawings were made in vectors using InkScape 0.91 in SVG format. Note there might be a problem with fonts, so it might not look the same on other computers. And I also observed some incompatibilities among InkScape versions, so minor editing may be needed. Few examples are shown in folloging images.
