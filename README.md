# Custom scales for analogue panel meters 
Sometimes, custom scale for analogue panel meter is needed. this repo contains few of mine scaled. Drawings are based on scan of original scale. 

## China 85C1
So far I have worked with some Chinese meter 85C1. It seems that is currently almost only existing in the market. Strange thing is, its scale actually does not match the needle. There was angular error of the end ticks by some almost 5 degrees. So I started fixing it. Next, I made few custom scales as needed. All drawings were made in vectors using InkScape 0.91 in SVG format. Note there might be a problem with fonts and also I observed some incompatibilities among InkScape versions.
